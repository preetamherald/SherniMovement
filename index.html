                           <p>
                               Sherni Movement is an initiative by our team aiming to encourage girls to take safety measures, giving them a fighting chance and ultimately make a better society for all of us.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                               We are creating a community, using an App <br>
                               Where people can report signs of distress and <b>We as a community can take actions to prevent them from going bigger and to stop such crimes from ever happening</b>. <br>
                               Providing Support to Those in Need. <br>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                               A Community consisting of peoples who want this world to change. <br>
                               Those who are willing to actually stand up to something and take actions which are necessary. <br>
                           </p>
                           <p>
